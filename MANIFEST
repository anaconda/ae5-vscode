# If you have additional extensions, you may put them here, following the
# same format. The download_vscode.sh script will download them, and the
# install_vscode.sh script will install them. If one extension depends
# upon another, it must appear earlier in this list. If you are manually
# populating the data/ directory with the files, just put the bare filename
# here instead.
